When I struggled with problem-solving, you didn\'t just give me answers - you guided me to discover solutions on my own, building my confidence along the way.\n\nThank you for being more than just a teacher. Your dedication and genuine care for your students will stay with me throughout my life.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\n[Student Name]'
